# abcjs-vscode

This is an editor for the ABC music notation, utilizing [abcjs](https://abcjs.net/) library.

ABC notation is the "Markdown for music". Learn more at https://abcnotation.com/.

Available at [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alensiljak.abcjs-vscode) or through the Extensions panel in VS Code.

## Features

The extension displays the music sheet based on the Abc notation in the current editor.
Clicking the note on the displayed sheet will select it in the editor.

### HTML Export

The Export command will export an HTML page with the rendered score sheet.

## Usage

Press Ctrl+Shift+P and type "abcjs" to access the available commands.

Available commands: 
- `abcjs-vscode: Show Preview`
- `abcjs-vscode: Print Preview`
- `abcjs-vscode.export`

## Requirements

The abcjs library is currently loaded from CDN and not packaged with the extension.

## Extension Settings

There are currently no configuration settings for the extension. It works on blank new files and existing .abc files.

<!--
Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something
-->

## Known Issues

The line-endings in the file need to be set to LF instead of CRLF (on Windows). Then the offsets will match between the sheet and the abc code.

## Release Notes

See [CHANGELOG.org](CHANGELOG.org).
